    " *  **Design a class** from `unittest.TestCase`\n",
    " *  **Create methods** with a`test_` prefix\n",
    " *  **Run tests** with a `unittest.main()` near the end of your code \n",

    "\n",
    " *  **test fixture** --- preparation/construction required to conduct tests, such as establishing database connections, folder structures or servers\n",
    " *  **test case** --- the atomic unit under test. A focused analysis on test behavior, using `TestCase`\n",
    " *  **test suite** ---  the entire collective of tests to be performed in a single context \n",
    " *  **test runner** --- the interface between the user and the test suite, controlling test execution\n",

Then we examined the improved syntax and behavior of the `pytest` library. We also looked at synthesizing data with `mimesis`. We finally discussed the concept of Chaos Engineering, with an aim to potential applications within your own work-flow."
